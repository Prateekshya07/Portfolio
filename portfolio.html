                <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
                <p>Greetings, I am Prateekshya Behera, currently a third-year Computer Science and Information Technology student at ITER, Siksha O Anusandhan. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in web development, particularly proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, I possess a grasp of Java, C, and C++ programming languages.

                    My formative educational years were spent at IEMS. Beyond the work of coding, I am a versatile individual with a flair for artistic expression. Painting and art have always been integral and important aspects of my life, fostering creativity and a keen eye for detail.
                    
                    Moreover, I am an avid reader. Delving into numerous novels fuels my passion for literature, broadening my perspectives and enhancing my analytical skills. This insatiable curiosity not only enriches my personal growth but also inspires me to write my own. I'm currently working on a manuscript, that someday I want to publish.</p>
